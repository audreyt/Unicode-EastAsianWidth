NAME
    Unicode::EastAsianWidth - East Asian Width properties

SYNOPSIS
        use Unicode::EastAsianWidth;

        $_ = chr(0x2010); # HYPHEN, an ambiguous-width character

        /\p{InEastAsianAmbiguous}/; # True
        /\p{InFullwidth}/;          # False

    To mark ambiguous-width characters as InFullwidth:

        BEGIN { $Unicode::EastAsianWidth::EastAsian = 1; }
        use Unicode::EastAsianWidth;

        $_ = chr(0x2010); # HYPHEN, an ambiguous-width character
        /\p{InFullwidth}/;          # True

DESCRIPTION
    This module provide user-defined Unicode properties that deal with width
    status of East Asian characters, as specified in
    <http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr11/>.

    It exports the following functions to the caller's scope, to be used by
    Perl's Unicode matching system: "InEastAsianFullwidth",
    "InEastAsianHalfwidth", "InEastAsianAmbiguous", "InEastAsianNarrow"
    "InEastAsianWide", "InEastAsianNeutral".

    In accord to TR11 cited above, two additional context-sensitive
    properties are exported: "InFullwidth" (union of "Fullwidth" and "Wide")
    and "InHalfwidth" (union of "Halfwidth", "Narrow" and "Neutral").

    *Ambiguous* characters are treated by default as part of "InHalfwidth",
    but you can modify this behaviour by assigning a true value to
    $Unicode::EastAsianWidth::EastAsian at compile time within a "BEGIN"
    block before loading this module:

        BEGIN { $Unicode::EastAsianWidth::EastAsian = 1; }
        use Unicode::EastAsianWidth;

    Setting $Unicode::EastAsianWidth::EastAsian at run-time used to work on
    Perl versions between 5.8 and 5.14 due to an implementation detail, but
    it will no longer work on Perl 5.16 and later versions, and hence is not
    recommended.
