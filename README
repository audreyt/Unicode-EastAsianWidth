NAME
    Unicode::EastAsianWidth - East Asian Width properties

VERSION
    This document describes version 1.10 of Unicode::EastAsianWidth,
    released October 14, 2007.

SYNOPSIS
        use Unicode::EastAsianWidth;

        $_ = chr(0x2588); # FULL BLOCK, an ambiguous-width character

        /\p{InEastAsianAmbiguous}/; # true
        /\p{InFullwidth}/;          # false

        {
            local $Unicode::EastAsianWidth::EastAsian = 1;
            /\p{InFullwidth}/;      # true; only works on perl 5.8+
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provide user-defined Unicode properties that deal with East
    Asian characters' width status, as specified in
    <http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr11/>.

    It exports the following functions to the caller's scope, to be used by
    Perl's Unicode matching system: "InEastAsianFullwidth",
    "InEastAsianHalfwidth", "InEastAsianAmbiguous", "InEastAsianNarrow"
    "InEastAsianWide", "InEastAsianNeutral".

    In accord to TR11 cited above, two additional context-sensitive
    properties are exported: "InFullwidth" (union of "Fullwidth" and "Wide")
    and "InHalfwidth" (union of "Halfwidth", "Narrow" and "Neutral").

    *Ambiguous* characters are treated by default as part of "InHalfwidth",
    but you can modify this behaviour by assigning a true value to
    $Unicode::EastAsianWidth::EastAsian.

CAVEATS
    Setting $Unicode::EastAsianWidth::EastAsian at run-time only works on
    Perl version 5.8 or above. Perl 5.6 users must use a BEGIN block to set
    it before the "use" statement:

        BEGIN { $Unicode::EastAsianWidth::EastAsian = 1 }
        use Unicode::EastAsianWidth;
